The primates were kept well away from the glare of the media as the delicate talks got under way.

The primates were kept well away from the glare of the media as the delicate talks got under way. This was in the knowledge that comments in the public domain could prompt a walkout by the most traditionalist nations, who are part of Global Anglican Future (GAFCON) - a potential rival leadership should the Anglican Communion divide on this issue. Their resolution was leaked on Thursday. It shows that they have agreed that by recognising same-sex marriage, the Episcopal Church in the US departed fundamentally from the faith and teaching of the Anglican Communion on the doctrine of marriage. The church will now be suspended from participating in the life and work of the Anglican Communion. The resolution stated that there were no victors and no vanquished.

Dr Laurie Marker, the trust's director, describes the horrific conditions involved in shipping the animals from their habitats in northern Kenya, Somaliland and Ethiopia by land and sea to the Arabian Gulf. "They're probably just thrown into a crate, living in their own faeces, travelling for days without proper food, and many of them end up dead on arrival at wherever that place would be, and maybe one or two living out of a pile that are dead."

The council will now write to the environment minister to seek clarification on how to go about the change. All previous attempts to change the name have failed.

Much of the work is now done by in-house police laboratories, many of which have not been accredited to a recognised international standard. The Home Office said: "We continue to ensure forces have access to the best possible forensic services." Figures obtained through Freedom of Information requests by The Sunday Post show North West police forces have cut their forensic science budgets by nearly £10m over the past five years. Greater Manchester Police has seen the biggest reduction, down from £18.7m in 2010-11 to £13.8m in 2013-14. Budget projections from Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd reveal plans to cut a further £1.6m by 2017. Lancashire Constabulary, meanwhile, has cut its forensic science budget from £3.3m in 2010-11 to about £990,000 in 2013-14. Mr Stringer, Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton, claimed "murderers and rapists are likely to go free" because of the cuts.

input: Four years ago, Professor Anthony King criticised the BBC at a UK level for ignoring political developments in Wales and Scotland. But in a Royal Television Society Wales lecture he said there had been "an enormous change" in how the BBC now reported on devolved nations. However, he said more could be done to compare policies across the UK. Delivering his speech at the RTS Wales annual lecture, Prof King said he believed that while mistakes still happen - it was much less common. "I think there has been enormous change," he said. "I live in the east of England, I look out for the failure of the BBC to mention what is going on in Wales, what's going on in Scotland and to give the impression that everything that affects England affects everybody else in the UK. "They make many fewer mistakes than they used to." His comments are in stark contrast to a review he carried out for the BBC Trust in 2008. In that report, the professor of government at Essex University, stated that the BBC was "not reporting the new UK with the range, clarity and richness that might reasonably be expected". Speaking in Cardiff on Thursday evening, he said the task now at hand for the BBC was to show more clearly just how devolution impacted on everyday policies across the UK. "If the</s>

input: The Chinese navy seized the US underwater research vessel in the South China Sea on Thursday, the US alleges. The incident took place just as the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic survey ship, was about to retrieve it. The device, dubbed an "ocean glider", was used to test water salinity and temperature, officials say. The data was part of an unclassified programme to map underwater channels, Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis told reporters. "It was taken" by China, Capt Davis said during a press briefing on Friday. "The UUV [unmanned underwater vehicle] was lawfully conducting a military survey in the waters of the South China Sea," he added. "It's a sovereign immune vessel, clearly marked in English not to be removed from the water - that it was US property." The Chinese seizure of a US navy drone only serves to increase uncertainty and tension between the US and China, coming in the same week as a US think tank published satellite images of anti-aircraft missiles on China's artificial islands in the South China Seas and in the aftermath of remarks from US President-elect Donald Trump criticising China for building what he called a "massive fortress" in the region.

"A lot's been made of Billy's carrying, and Toby's been absolutely phenomenal in defence for us," said Owens. "So it'll be an interesting battle that'll get the ground shaking!" Vunipola made 18 carries for a total gain of 96 metres against Ireland, while Faletau was Wales's top tackler with 20 against France. Faletau and the Vunipola brothers, Billy and prop Mako, grew up together in Pontypool before the Vunipola family moved to England. "They're both world-class number eights who are both at the top of their game at the moment," said Owens. Owens says he won't be out to wind-up England captain Dylan Hartley at Twickenham, despite his opponent's poor disciplinary record.

input: The Supreme Court has ruled against a father who took his daughter on an unauthorised term-time break. But between travel companies' elevated school holiday prices and the need to juggle work commitments, some parents say they cannot always go away during the school holidays and that it should be their decision to make. Hayley, 39, says she is "fuming" at the ruling. Together with her husband Martin, the couple, from Cheshire, took their children Archie, aged five, and Ruby, six, out of school in January to attend a family wedding in India. As Archie was under five at the time, his absence did not cause problems. But Ruby's did. Not long after they returned, letters arrived from the local council to inform them that they were being fined a total of Â£120. "I'm not going to pay it," she said. "They basically brandish you a criminal." Hayley had asked the school for permission but says she never received a reply. "Why should you be dictated to?" she said. "It's made no difference to Ruby.

Some bedrooms had not been cleaned properly for a month, it said. Rotherwood Healthcare apologised in a statement to the Shropshire Star. The Care Quality Commission will inspect the home in six months, but if improvements have not been made it faces losing its licence. The home, which cares for 60 people with dementia and nursing needs, was visited in November. Inspectors found a poorly-run home, with staff so hard-pressed residents were left in their beds for hours. "People were shouting for help from their bedrooms to get out of bed and we had to seek staff members to provide support for these people on a number of occasions," inspectors said. "One person told us, 'you can't put a time on it but I hope I am up before 11am'." They found one resident "visibly in pain" waiting days for medicine and others had "appeared to have lost weight" and "showed signs of dehydration". Some areas of the home were "visibly dirty" with a strong smell of urine, the report said. The manager of the home resigned in August, and while a</s>

The idea of using quotas to resettle those who have made it to Europe has caused controversy in some EU states. The UK government says that it will not take part in such a system. France, Spain, Hungary, Slovakia and Estonia have also all voiced concerns, and a final decision will be taken by EU governments after a vote by MEPs. Denmark has the right to opt out of the plan while Ireland and the UK can decide whether they wish to opt in. The plan applies to Syrian and Eritrean nationals who arrive in Italy or Greece after 15 April 2015. The Commission said it could also apply to Malta if it also faced a sudden influx of migrants. This is in addition to moves announced earlier this month by the EU for a voluntary scheme to settle 20,000 refugees fleeing conflict who are currently living outside the EU. Of the 40,000 migrants considered "in clear need of international protection", the Commission says: Dimitris Avramopoulos, the home affairs commissioner, said it was not proposing "the fixing of quotas... for migration in general" and but it was "up to each member to decide how many refugees they will grant refugee status [to]".

input: Gerry Holtham was commissioned by the Welsh government to look at the pros and cons of the way that government gets its budget. He found, among other things, that Wales would be treated more generously if Wales were funded on the basis of need rather than the population-based Barnett formula. Politicians have used his findings ever since to make the case for a change to the formula on the basis of the shortfall suffered by the Welsh government. I've been talking to Gerry Holtham as part of a discussion on a report he wrote for the Institute of Welsh Affairs. So how big is that shortfall? He told me: "At the time we did the research it was Â£300 m to Â£400 m a year less than it would get if it were an English region getting needs-based grants. We don't know what that is now. "Given the squeeze on public finances it's probably a smaller number, the shortfall is probably less than it was then. Even then, it was only a couple of per cent of the Welsh budget so we're probably down to one per cent of the Welsh budget." In comments that may yet be worth recalling the next time you hear a politician use his figures, he added: "It's not going to change the world. Welsh government</s>
