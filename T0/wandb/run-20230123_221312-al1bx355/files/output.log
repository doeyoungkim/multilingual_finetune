The primates were kept well away from the glare of the media as the delicate talks got under way. This was in the knowledge that comments in the public domain could prompt a walkout by the most traditionalist nations, who are part of Global Anglican Future (GAFCON) - a potential rival leadership should the Anglican Communion divide on this issue.

But the trade exacts a terrible toll on a species that claims a superlative status as the fastest land animal on the planet but which now faces a serious threat to its survival. According to the Cheetah Conservation Fund, some 1,200 cheetah cubs are known to have been trafficked out of Africa over the past 10 years but a shocking 85% of them died during the journey.

The prosecution told the court that "they were driven by money... to make more profit on their trading". The five defendants deny one count of conspiracy to defraud. The court also heard that the financial position of every company, every government, perhaps every household was directly or indirectly sensitive to Libor in one way or another. The trial at Southwark Crown Court, which began on Tuesday, is expected to last 12 weeks. Prosecution counsel James Hines QC said that to maximise their profits, the defendants agreed to manipulate or rig the US dollar Libor rate to the advantage of their trades and to the disadvantage of the people who they were doing trades with. Submitters, who contributed to the setting of the Libor rate by revealing the interest rates at which their banks were willing to lend at, were told if the traders wanted the rate to go up or down, the prosecution alleged.

Much of the work is now done by in-house police laboratories, many of which have not been accredited to a recognised international standard. The Home Office said: "We continue to ensure forces have access to the best possible forensic services." Figures obtained through Freedom of Information requests by The Sunday Post show North West police forces have cut their forensic science budgets by nearly £10m over the past five years. Greater Manchester Police has seen the biggest reduction, down from £18.7m in 2010-11 to £13.8m in 2013-14. Budget projections from Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd reveal plans to cut a further £1.6m by 2017. Lancashire Constabulary, meanwhile, has cut its forensic science budget from £3.3m in 2010-11 to about £990,000 in 2013-14. Mr Stringer, Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton, claimed "murderers and rapists are likely to go free" because of the cuts. He said it was "good news for criminals" and has made "a very bad situation worse".

The White House is coy about how much the president has played golf so far during his time in office, but given that he's visited his golf properties at least 43 times so far, he almost certainly has teed up more at this point in his administration than any past president. So while he's lining up his shots over the next two weeks, will memories of his past six months in office break his concentration? Will an ill-timed twinge of concern turn what would have been a solid drive into a wayward slice or cause a sure-thing birdie putt to lip out of the hole? How many of his apparently unlimited supply of mulligans will he have to use to soothe a troubled mind? The president may comfort himself with thoughts of low unemployment or a booming stock market.

But in a Royal Television Society Wales lecture he said there had been "an enormous change" in how the BBC now reported on devolved nations. However, he said more could be done to compare policies across the UK. Delivering his speech at the RTS Wales annual lecture, Prof King said he believed that while mistakes still happen - it was much less common. "I think there has been enormous change," he said. "I live in the east of England, I look out for the failure of the BBC to mention what is going on in Wales, what's going on in Scotland and to give the impression that everything that affects England affects everybody else in the UK. "They make many fewer mistakes than they used to." His comments are in stark contrast to a review he carried out for the BBC Trust in 2008. In that report, the professor of government at Essex University, stated that the BBC was "not reporting the new UK with the range, clarity and richness that might reasonably be expected".

input: Germany, France and Spain would receive the most migrants under the Commission's latest plan. The idea of using quotas to resettle those who have made it to Europe has caused controversy in some EU states. The UK government says that it will not take part in such a system. France, Spain, Hungary, Slovakia and Estonia have also all voiced concerns, and a final decision will be taken by EU governments after a vote by MEPs. Denmark has the right to opt out of the plan while Ireland and the UK can decide whether they wish to opt in. The plan applies to Syrian and Eritrean nationals who arrive in Italy or Greece after 15 April 2015. The Commission said it could also apply to Malta if it also faced a sudden influx of migrants. This is in addition to moves announced earlier this month by the EU for a voluntary scheme to settle 20,000 refugees fleeing conflict who are currently living outside the EU. Of the 40,000 migrants considered "in clear need of international protection", the Commission says: Dimitris Avramopoulos, the home affairs commissioner, said it was not proposing "the fixing of quotas... for migration in general" and but it was "up to each member to decide how many refugees they will grant refugee status [to]".

input: Gerry Holtham was commissioned by the Welsh government to look at the pros and cons of the way that government gets its budget. He found, among other things, that Wales would be treated more generously if Wales were funded on the basis of need rather than the population-based Barnett formula. Politicians have used his findings ever since to make the case for a change to the formula on the basis of the shortfall suffered by the Welsh government. I've been talking to Gerry Holtham as part of a discussion on a report he wrote for the Institute of Welsh Affairs. So how big is that shortfall? He told me: "At the time we did the research it was Â£300 m to Â£400 m a year less than it would get if it were an English region getting needs-based grants. We don't know what that is now. "Given the squeeze on public finances it's probably a smaller number, the shortfall is probably less than it was then. Even then, it was only a couple of per cent of the Welsh budget so we're probably down to one per cent of the Welsh budget." In comments that may yet be worth recalling the next time you hear a politician use his figures, he added: "It's not going to change the world. Welsh government</s>

But after passing stringent new safety tests, Kyushu Electric Power restarted the number one reactor at its Sendai plant on Tuesday morning. There is still strong public unease about a return to nuclear power.
