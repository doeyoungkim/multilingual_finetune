The president says a new constitution will bring peace to Venezuela, but the opposition says it is a ruse to delay holding elections. More than 50 people have been killed in protest-related violence since 1 April. Mr Maduro signed the decree at a rally attended by thousands of his supporters. He said the assembly would be made up of 540 members, some of whom would be elected at local level while the rest would be chosen from various groups such as students, workers, farmers, pensioners, and indigenous people. The National Electoral Council later said that elections for the constituent assembly would be held at the end of July. The move was immediately denounced by the opposition-controlled National Assembly. National Assembly leader Julio Borges called it "nothing more than an evil announcement meant to divide, distract, and confuse Venezuelans further". He said there would be more "street action" and called for a march opposing the constituent assembly to be held on Wednesday. Fifty-five people have been killed in protests since the beginning of April. The unrest was sparked by a Supreme Court ruling on 29 March stripping the National Assembly of its powers and transferring those powers to the court. The Supreme Court suspended the most controversial paragraphs three days later, but the ruling united the hitherto divided opposition and spurred them into action. The opposition says the Supreme Court ruling and Mr Maduro's call for a constituent assembly are attempts by the president to cling on to power beyond the end of his term in 2019. They say that he has become increasingly authoritarian since he was elected in 2013, blocking their attempts to hold a recall referendum and delaying elections for governors. On Tuesday, National Electoral Council head Tibisay Lucena also announced that the gubernatorial elections would be held on 10 December, a year after they were originally due.

Regional forces in Somalia said he was one of 16 people killed in an overnight raid on their convoy in Kismayo, a port city in southern Somalia. Four of those who died were reportedly senior members of the al-Shabab Islamist militant group. The BBC's Africa security correspondent, Tomi Oladipo, said the news comes as a huge boost for Somalia and its allies in the fight against al-Shabab. However, at least 10 people were killed on Wednesday by a car bomb outside a hotel in Somalia's capital Mogadishu, that was claimed by al-Shabab. The news of Kuno's death was confirmed in a press conference held by Abdirashid Janan, the security minister in the Somali region of Jubaland. Mohamed Kuno: Kenya's most wanted Africa Live: Latest updates After the Garissa attack, Kenya's government put up a $215,000 (Â£149,000) reward for Kuno's capture. A Kenyan-Somali, he was a headmaster at a madrassa, or Islamic school, in Garissa until 2007. But then he crossed the border into Somalia to join the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC), which at one point controlled much of the country. When the UIC collapsed, he joined the militant group Hizbul Islam, which in 2010 merged with al-Shabab. He had several aliases but was best known as Mohamed Dulyadin, which means ambidextrous in the Somali language. He was thought to be in mid-30s. Attack as it happened Who were Garissa victims? Why does al-Shabab target Kenya? In the university attack on 2 April last year, four al-Shabab militants shot students in their dormitories before rounding up and killing dozens more. The four gunmen were killed during the siege but it took 16 hours for anti-terrorism forces to bring the attack to an end. It was the deadliest attack in Kenya since al-Qaeda's bombing of the</s>

Instead, they are the attributes with which Scotland's tourism agency is seeking to engage Scots and their spirit in making the country more attractive to visitors. There's a lot to do if VisitScotland and the industry are to hit an ambitious target. And it's one of the sectors that needs to succeed if Scotland is to turn around a formidable rise in its trade imbalance. The trade imbalance may not matter much, so long as Scotland is tied into the pound and part of the UK. But it is a useful indicator of economic health, and rather important to those who want to see another independence referendum. The Scottish government's figures for the whole Scottish economy have just been published, to cover the third quarter of last year, up to September. They show that, between July and September, Scots sold £6.1bn of goods and services overseas. They imported £5.1bn. That's a trade surplus, while the UK as a whole is running some very large external trade deficits. So that can't be bad for Scotland. But what about trade within the UK? Scots sold goods and services worth £10.4bn in the third quarter to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The flow coming the other way was rather larger: £15.2bn. The trade deficit with the rest of the UK rose to £14bn in 2014, from an economy with total output of nearly £140bn. John McLaren, a keen observer of these numbers, who used to work for Public Finance Scotland, observes that the first nine months of last year saw that deteriorate sharply. Roughly £750m less was being sold to the rest of the UK, and £750m more was being bought from it. The fall in sales success to this dominant market, McLaren points out, has real implications for prosperity and jobs. Exports and imports, overseas and to the rUK</s>
