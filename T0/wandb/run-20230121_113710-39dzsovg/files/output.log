{'article': 'Most women change their hairstyle following an emotional break-up, but one woman went about changing her appearance in a much more dramatic way. When feisty Amanda Brignall hit a mid-life-crisis she decided to cover her body in tattoos - but now she can’t get a man because her appearance scares them off. The mother-of-two’s ink obsession started at 37 after she separated from her husband and her children flew the nest. Scroll down for video . Tattooed lady: Amanda Brignall covered herself in tattoos when she hit a midlife crisis. After she divorced from her husband, she covered 80 per cent of her body in ink . Since then she’s dramatically changed her ‘mumsy’ look - adding a new design to her skin almost every week. Now 80 per cent of her body is covered - including her face. The 49-year-old, from the sleepy town of Beverley in Yorkshire, says she has no regrets - but not everyone loves her tattoos as much as she does. Known as ‘the freak of Beverley’, she hasn’t been in a relationship for the past seven years. Regrets: Although she originally inked herself to make herself feel less \'mumsy\', she is now regretting the decision because she can\'t get a man because her appearance scares them off . She said: \'I love my tattoos but men don’t seem to feel the same. My appearance seems to scare them off. \'I’ve only ever been on one date in seven years. That was through a tattoo-lovers dating site - but it didn’t last. \'I think when men first look at me, they think I’m a bit rough. They mutter ‘look at the state of her’ under their breath. They don’t bother to get to know me.\' Amanda is proud of her tattoos and never covers them up - apart from when she visits her 80-year-old mother. Where it all began: Amanda, who suffers from . osteoporosis and is currently unemployed, got her first tattoo done when . she was 18 (pictured, L, age 28, and R, age 19) Taunted: She is known around her hometown as \'the freak of Beverley\' so she got \'Talk to the hand\' scribed on her palm to fend off negative comments . Proud: Despite the negativity, she is proud of her looks and only covers her tattoos up when she pays a visit to her 80-year-old grandmother . She said: \'The only place I haven’t got tattooed is my bum and that’s because I don’t see the point - afterall, who’s going to see it? \'But my mum hates my tattoos, so whenever she comes round I wear a jumper and scarf. It makes me feel a bit like a teenager but I prefer to avoid rowing. But besides her, I won’t cover up for anyone.\' When Amanda’s marriage came to an end after 10 years, she moved to the small market town of Beverley to live near her parents. She said: \'I started working in a newsagents where I met a local tattoo artist. She specialised in designs of pin up girls, and one day I thought - "I want one of them". \'My dress and hair had always been quite normal before, but I felt like a change. I’d always been a bit mumsy - wearing baggy jumpers, leggings and no makeup. Time for a change: When Amanda\'s marriage came to an end after 10 years, she moved to the small market town of Beverley to live near her parents and underwent a style makeover . Addiction: She became addicted to getting tattoos, especially after becoming close friends with the artist and getting them for free (pictured here with tattoo artist Jimmy at a Tattoo Parlour in Yorkshire) \'But I wanted to add a bit of glamour into my life. I had Marilyn Monroe done, then Bettie Page. \'I loved the way they looked so feminine. After all, I like to make an effort. There’s no way I’d go out of the house without any makeup on.\' Amanda admits that tattooing became an addiction after the tattoo artist became a close friend and offered to ink her for free. She said: \'Once I started, I couldn’t stop - it became an addiction.\' Three years ago, Amanda decided to start dating again. She said: \'I didn’t think there was much chance of meeting the man of my dreams in Beverley, so I went on nights out in Hull to Spiders Nightclub. What a difference: Amanda thinks she had always been a bit mumsy - wearing baggy jumpers, leggings and no makeup (pictured, L, 25 and, R, 38) \'I felt more at home there, and people would come up to me and tell me how amazing my tattoos were. But often, that’s as far as the conversation went.\' So Amanda decided to sign up to a dating website for tattoo lovers. She said: \'I knew I wouldn’t have much luck with normal men because I don’t think they like to be seen with a tattooed woman, so I decided to try and hit it off with people like me. But I only went on one date, and the guy only had one tattoo. I wasn’t very impressed.\' Over the years Amanda has become so disheartened that she is ready to give up on the dating game. She said: \'I don’t think there’s much chance of me being in a relationship now. \'But I don’t regret getting them done. I think people should be able to see past the tattoos and accept who the person is on the inside and not on the outside.\' Out and about: She says people would come up to her and tell her how amazing her tattoos were. But often, that\'s as far as the conversation went . Amanda, who suffers from osteoporosis and is currently unemployed, got her first tattoo done when she was 18. But it wasn’t until her marriage ended in divorce and her two sons, aged 24 and 21, left home, that her obsession snowballed. She said: \'I had a bit of a midlife crisis. I got to 44 and realised that my marriage was in tatters. I was also unemployed because I’d developed osteoporosis in my back. I felt old and rejected. \'But then I started getting more tattoos done and every time I got inked, I felt a new lease of life. Now people look at me and they can’t believe I’m nearly 50.\' She added: \'I get a lot of negative responses. People are really judgemental. They call me ‘the freak of Beverley’. But at the end of the day it’s just small-town mentality.\' Covered: The only part of her body where she doesn\'t have a tattoo is on her bottom because she \'doesn\'t see the point\' The abuse got so bad that Amanda even had ‘talk to the hand’ tattooed on her palm, now she shows it whenever she gets a negative comment. She added: \'I did worry what people would think, but then I thought, so what, it’s my body, not theirs. Mum wouldn’t speak to me for days afterwards though, and dad’s just given up on me. \'Sometimes I do worry that my tattoos will affect my ability to get a job in the future, because I do think employers judge you on your appearance. But I don’t have any regrets - it’s all worth it.\' Now her eldest son Ben Clarkson, 24, who is a cobbler, is following in his mum’s footsteps - he has had 40 tattoos done. Meanwhile her youngest son Max Clarkson, 21, who is a hairdresser, has just experimented with a tiny star. Amanda said: \'It doesn’t bother me that my boys have had tattoos done - that’s up to him. As long as they don’t offend anyone. \'Sometimes I worry that he’s getting the same abuse that I do, but then I remind myself that he can look after himself. I’m just glad that he’s brave enough to be individual, just like his mum.\'', 'highlights': "Amanda Brignall, 49, hit midlife crisis at 37 and turned to ink .\nBreakdown of 10 year marriage left her insecure .\nKnown as 'the freak of Beverley' where she lives in Yorkshire .\nAbuse got so bad that she had ‘talk to the hand’ tattooed on palm .", 'id': '57dac97e476e6736cc249f4856309011632f57d9'}
