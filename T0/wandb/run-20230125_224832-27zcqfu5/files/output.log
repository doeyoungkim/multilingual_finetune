October's decision by the AQA board to drop the subject provoked an outcry from experts who argued "society had never required its insights more". "It's amazing - just about in the nick of time," said teacher Sarah Phillips. Ms Phillips, from state sixth form Godalming College, developed the new syllabus with AQA and added: "Now we need to get the message out to Year 11 students as soon as possible." Subject to approval by Ofqual, Ms Phillips says she expects Pearson to build on her work which has been made available to the Department for Education by AQA. "It is a global specification. Students won't just study the work of dead white men," she said. "They will have the opportunity to study Islamic architecture and work by men and women of all colours and creeds. The support has been overwhelming," she added. In October, top experts signed an open letter to AQA condemning the decision not to offer the A-level to new students after this year. AQA was the last board to offer the subject and the decision represented "a vital loss for students", they argued. At the time AQA said the change "was not about money or whether history of art deserves a place in the curriculum", but said that it feared the new qualification was so wide-ranging that accurate marking would be impossible. Pearson, which also announced plans to take on AS and A-levels in statistics, also dropped by AQA, said awarding organisations, government and schools should work together in the interests of students to secure the future of important qualifications. "The response from the public, from teachers and from young people shows many people have a real passion for these subjects. We're happy to help make sure they remain available," said the company's president, Rod Bristow. The move was welcomed by leading academics and museum directors as well as by Turner Prize winners Anish Kapoor, Cornelia Parker and Jeremy Deller. Mr Kapoor said... === Write a summary</s>

Ms Telwar suddenly found that her Atlanta-based business Anisa International - today one of the world's largest designer and manufacturer of make-up brushes - had nowhere to get its products produced. Describing the situation as "pretty scary", and faced with the possibility of her business having to shut down, she instead determined to fly to China and secure her own factory. The Anisa International plant, based in the city of Tianjin in northern China, now makes more than 25 million make-up brushes per year. Ms Telwar, 48, looks back on the split with her former South Korean partner as being like the break-up of a marriage - yet one with a happy ending. "It was a bit like a divorce," she says. "But at the end of the day, it was probably one of the best things that ever happened." Owning her own factory meant that she took full control of the manufacturing process, allowing her to design new products more freely, she says. And thanks to this newer, wider range of make-up brushes, Anisa International's sales have increased substantially. Today, the company has annual revenues of more than $30m (Â£18.5m). It is a "white label business" in that it makes its make-up brushes for other firms, including many of the big names in cosmetics, such as Estee Lauder and Sephora. Born in New York, but raised in Nashville, Tennessee, Ms Telwar undoubtedly gets some of her business drive from her Russian mother Fatima Telwar, who after a childhood in Turkey emigrated to the US. Fatima Telwar ran her own import and export business, buying general goods in the Middle East, such as rugs, and then selling them in the US.
